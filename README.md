Additionally, I have a Certificate in Machine Learning Foundations at Cornell Tech, Cornell University.

## 👩‍💻 Tech Enthusiast & Lifelong Learner 👩‍💻

My journey in technology has been marked by my unwavering passion for machine learning, web development, and all things tech-related. I thrive on the challenge of picking up new skills, and my coursework at CCNY, combined with my experiences, reflects my commitment to becoming a versatile technologist.

## 🗣️ Effective Communication and Collaboration 🗣️

One of my standout qualities is my ability to communicate effectively and collaborate seamlessly with diverse teams.

My dedication extends to understanding user needs and leveraging technology to bridge the gap. As a Breakthrough Tech Mentee at ASAPP, I worked closely with the team to improve customer service interactions using NLP. My experience as an AI Fellow and Summer Guild Member at Break Through Tech @ Cornell Tech allowed me to explore various machine learning applications and web development projects, demonstrating my versatility.

## 🛠️ Projects That Make a Difference 🛠️

I've had the privilege of participating in impactful projects, such as hosting websites, building NLP-powered applications, and creating automated solutions. Whether it's applying NLP to enhance content management or developing chatbots to improve user experiences, I'm driven by the potential of technology to make a difference.

## 🥳 Building Tomorrow's Tech Today 🥳

As a Full Stack Fellow at CUNY Tech Prep, I'm currently developing a web application to help users find their perfect outfit. This project, like many others, showcases my proficiency in technologies like React, Node.js, Express, and PostgreSQL.
