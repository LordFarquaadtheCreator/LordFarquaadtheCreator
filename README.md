# Hello, I'm Fahad 👋
I like building apps that make my life easier. I'm an incredibly lazy person and programming helps me stay that way. Whether it be automating deployment via Github applications, or developing applications to avoid touching GUI - I love building apps that make my life easier. 
Because of this, I'm a backend type of developer, you won't see me touching front end any time soon.
